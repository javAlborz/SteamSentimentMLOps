<h1>Project Description</h1>
<p>The goal of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on user reviews from the gaming platform Steam using the transformers library and the Hugging Face framework.
In this project, we will be using a transformer-based model to classify the sentiment of user reviews as either positive or negative. The dataset contains more than 6 million user entries and is available on Kaggle.</p>
<p>The idea is to download a model like BERT or DistilBERT with pre-trained weights and then fine-tune it on our own specific dataset.  We will then evaluate the performance of the model on a held-out test set and use it to classify the sentiment of unseen reviews.</p>
<p>Naturally, all components of the course should be implemented in the project (pipelines, deployment, monitoring, etc.), with the model supporting this.
Applications of such a model and infrastructure include predicting review scores, building more advanced recommender systems based on what users find important, and assisting developers in predicting what users value in their games.</p>
<h1>Exam template for 02476 Machine Learning Operations</h1>
<p>This is the report template for the exam. Please only remove the text formatted as with three dashes in front and behind
like:</p>
<p><code>--- question 1 fill here ---</code></p>
<p>where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is auto
generated in the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image to
the <code>figures</code> subfolder (please only use <code>.png</code>, <code>.jpg</code> or <code>.jpeg</code>) and then add the following code in your answer:</p>
<p><code>markdown
![my_image](figures/&lt;image&gt;.&lt;extension&gt;)</code></p>
<p>In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the <code>report.py</code> script that provides two utility functions:</p>
<p>Running:</p>
<p><code>bash
python report.py html</code></p>
<p>will generate an <code>.html</code> page of your report. After deadline for answering this template, we will autoscrape
everything in this <code>reports</code> folder and then use this utility to generate an <code>.html</code> page that will be your serve
as your final handin.</p>
<p>Running</p>
<p><code>bash
python report.py check</code></p>
<p>will check your answers in this template against the constrains listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, have you included an image when asked to.</p>
<p>For both functions to work it is important that you do not rename anything. The script have two dependencies that can
be installed with <code>pip install click markdown</code>.</p>

<h2>Group information</h2>
<h3>Question 1</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Enter the group number you signed up on <learn.inside.dtu.dk></strong></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Group 50</p>
<h3>Question 2</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Enter the study number for each member in the group</strong></p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p><em>sXXXXXX, sXXXXXX, sXXXXXX</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Students s202075, s212503, s212676, s212677, and s222902</p>
<h3>Question 3</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What framework did you choose to work with and did it help you complete the project?</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We used the third-party framework ... in our project. We used functionality ... and functionality ... from the</em>
<em>package to do ... and ... in our project</em>.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We used the Hugging Face Transformers library, built on PyTorch, to train a model on a dataset of Steam game reviews. We first preprocessed the text data to clean and format it, and then used the pre-trained DistilBERT model from the Transformers library as the base for our model. We fine-tuned the DistilBERT model on our dataset and used it to classify the reviews as positive or negative. The PyTorch framework allowed us to easily train the model and make use of GPU acceleration for faster training times. We also utilized Hugging Face's built-in evaluation metrics and visualization tools to evaluate the performance of the model. Overall, the combination of the Hugging Face Transformers library and PyTorch made it relatively simple to train a high-performing model on our dataset.</p>
<h2>Coding environment</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In the following section we are interested in learning more about you local development environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Question 4</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Explain how you managed dependencies in your project? Explain the process a new team member would have to go</strong>
<strong>through to get an exact copy of your environment.</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 100-200 words</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We used ... for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using ... . To get a</em>
<em>complete copy of our development enviroment, one would have to run the following commands</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my project, I managed dependencies using a combination of pip, a requirements.txt file and virtual environment. The requirements.txt file contains a list of all the packages and their versions that are required for the project to run correctly. To set up an exact copy of the environment, a new team member would need to have Python, pip and virtualenv installed on their machine. They would then navigate to the root directory of the project, create a virtual environment and activate it, and run the command 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to install all the dependencies listed in the requirements file. This ensures that all team members are working with the same versions of packages and helps to avoid compatibility issues. It also makes the project fully reproducible.</p>
<h3>Question 5</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>We expect that you initialized your project using the cookiecutter template. Explain the overall structure of your</strong>
<strong>code. Did you fill out every folder or only a subset?</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 100-200 words</p>
<p>Example:
<em>From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the ... , ... and ... folder. We have removed the ... folder</em>
<em>because we did not use any ... in our project. We have added an ... folder that contains ... for running our</em>
<em>experiments.</em>
Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using the provided Cookie cutter template we fill most of the source folders, preserving only data (cleaning up the text for sentiment analysis), models (creation, training and prediction), visualization (general model reporting, loss function etc.), tests (cloud model testing). Furthermore, the data was saved in the data folder using DVC connection with google drive, pictures and information related to model performance were saved in the reports folder, and the reference folder was filled with codes that we took inspiration from for sentiment analysis using transformers. For the docker archive, requirements and dvc have been established in the root of the repository to work with new requests and updates of new data or code.</p>
<h3>Question 6</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you implement any rules for code quality and format? Additionally, explain with your own words why these</strong>
<strong>concepts matters in larger projects.</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 50-100 words.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pylint has been implemented in the GitHub Actions pipeline to check for many possible code and formatting issues. We set a threshold of 0.8 code conformity, that means in every git push attempt the code would be tested and if the final formatting score wasnt greater than 0.8, the push would be rejected.</p>
<h2>Version control</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In the following section we are interested in how version control was used in your project during development to
corporate and increase the quality of your code.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Question 7</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How many tests did you implement and what are they testing in your code?</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 50-100 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>In total we have implemented X tests. Primarily we are testing ... and ... as these the most critical parts of our</em>
<em>application but also ... .</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In total we have implemented 4 tests for the make_dataset.py file. Those would check the size of the dataset, wether all classes were present in train, test, and valiadation and also if all the required columns were there. The other test files, corresponding to train_model.py, predict_model.py were populated with a dummy test.
These tests are automatically run when a pull request has been created, and will give feedback to the developer when they don't pass.</p>
<h3>Question 8</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What is the total code coverage (in percentage) of your code? If you code had an code coverage of 100% (or close</strong>
<strong>to), would you still trust it to be error free? Explain you reasoning.</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>The total code coverage of code is X%, which includes all our source code. We are far from 100% coverage of our </em><em>
</em>code and even if we were then...*</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>```
Name                          Stmts   Miss  Cover   Missing</p>
<hr />
<p>src_init_.py                   0      0   100%
src\data_init_.py              0      0   100%
src\data\make_dataset.py         50     12    76%   29-34, 85-87, 91-101
tests_init_.py                 4      0   100%
tests\test_make_dataset.py       36      0   100%
tests\test_predict_model.py       3      0   100%
tests\test_train_model.py         3      0   100%</p>
<hr />
<p>TOTAL                            96     12    88%
```</p>
<p>This was the output of our coverage run. Actually, the only file we had real tests for was the make_dataset.py, and it got a result of 76%. We are not really sure why the coverage for files we didnt have real unittests for yielded a result of 100%. As our model took so long to run, it was hard to develop tests for the train_model.py file.</p>
<h3>Question 9</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you workflow include using branches and pull requests? If yes, explain how. If not, explain how branches and</strong>
<strong>pull request can help improve version control.</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We made use of both branches and PRs in our project. In our group, each member had an branch that they worked on in</em>
<em>addition to the main branch. To merge code we ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the development of the project we put some rules in the repository, where at first the main branch would be protected for changes in order not to affect the code developed so far. For parallel work we set up branches where we create, the docker file, model checking, and other tasks involved to solve the problem. To maintain a clear management of the repository, we connected to Git Kraken and established an internal rule to perform several commits with comments to understand what was developed. For the merge git kraken was used as well, along with tests were created after the merge to verify that everything is in order</p>
<h3>Question 10</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you use DVC for managing data in your project? If yes, then how did it improve your project to have version</strong>
<strong>control of your data. If no, explain a case where it would be beneficial to have version control of your data.</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We did make use of DVC in the following way: ... . In the end it helped us in ... for controlling ... part of our</em>
<em>pipeline</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We use DVC to manage the data involved in the model, where we add the model, data and other files that do not involve code to the response. Also, folders have been added to the gitignore file in order not to cause conflicts in commits and merge. DVC was very useful for the development of the project, because we could update with new data, and replicate to other computers using the rules. In general, even using GCP we kept the data archive in Google drive where it would be easier to replicate the execution of the modules and progress with the project.</p>
<h3>Question 11</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Discuss you continues integration setup. What kind of CI are you running (unittesting, linting, etc.)? Do you test</strong>
<strong>multiple operating systems, python version etc. Do you make use of caching? Feel free to insert a link to one of</strong>
<strong>your github actions workflow.</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 200-300 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We have organized our CI into 3 separate files: one for doing ..., one for running ... testing and one for running</em>
<em>... . In particular for our ..., we used ... .An example of a triggered workflow can be seen here: <weblink></em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>GitHub Actions have been setup for pylint and unittests. <a href="../.github/workflows/pylint.yml">pylint.yml</a> runs pylint for all <code>.py</code> files according to the <a href="../.pylintrc">config file</a>. This config file specifies what things to test for (style, typing, imports, etc.), but also more specific things such as line lengths and good variable names. If the pylint score is lower than 8.0/10.0 then the check will fail and problems will have to be fixed, when it passes a pull request can be merged. <a href="../.github/workflows/tests.yml">tests.yml</a> runs all tests using pytest. </p>
<h2>Running code and tracking experiments</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In the following section we are interested in learning more about the experimental setup for running your code and
especially the reproducibility of your experiments.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Question 12</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How did you configure experiments? Did you make use of config files? Explain with coding examples of how you would</strong>
<strong>run a experiment.</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 50-100 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We used a simple argparser, that worked in the following way: python my_script.py --lr 1e-3 --batch_size 25</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using config files and Hydra we would have the default parameters and while running a new experiment we would overwrite the config file with new parameters so that the output model would be saved in the Hydra output folder. Additionaly, each run could be monitored in weights and biases, with a new name attributed to it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we used argparser to determine batch and sample size. To run the model locally we used the following command:</p>
<p>python src/models/train_model.py params.sample_size=100 params.batch_size=2</p>
<p>Even though the model was run locally we could compare the experiments and try to understand what was happening with each run, to try to apply the same logic in the cloud.</p>
<h3>Question 13</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Reproducibility of experiments are important. Related to the last question, how did you secure that no information</strong>
<strong>is lost when running experiments and that your experiments are reproducible?</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We made use of config files. Whenever an experiment is run the following happens: ... . To reproduce an experiment</em>
<em>one would have to do ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We use config files. For every experiment, hydra created a new folder with the settings of that run, so it was possible to check the hyperparameters for that experiment. With this alternative it was possible to simplify the iteration and improvement process for the training and thus try to extract the maximum from the provided model. </p>
<h3>Question 14</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Upload 1 to 3 screenshots that show the experiments that you have done in W&amp;B (or another experiment tracking</strong>
<strong>service of your choice). This may include loss graphs, logged images, hyperparameter sweeps etc. You can take</strong>
<strong>inspiration from <a href="figures/wandb.png">this figure</a>. Explain what metrics you are tracking and why they are</strong>
<strong>important.</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 200-300 words + 1 to 3 screenshots.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>As seen in the first image when have tracked ... and ... which both inform us about ... in our experiments.</em>
<em>As seen in the second image we are also tracking ... and ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See the wandb screenshot in <a href="figures/hugging_wandb.jpeg">figure</a>.</p>
<h3>Question 15</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Docker is an important tool for creating containerized applications. Explain how you used docker in your</strong>
<strong>experiments? Include how you would run your docker images and include a link to one of your docker files.</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>For our project we developed several images: one for training, inference and deployment. For example to run the</em>
<em>training docker image: <code>docker run trainer:latest lr=1e-3 batch_size=64</code>. Link to docker file: <weblink></em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In our project, we used Docker to containerize the application and its dependencies, making it easy to run the application in different environments with the same configuration.</p>
<p>We created a Dockerfile, which is a script that contains instructions for building a Docker image. The Dockerfile specifies the base image, the dependencies that need to be installed, and any additional configurations needed for the application to run.</p>
<p>To build the Docker image, we ran the command docker build -f <Dockerfile name> . -t <image name> in the root directory of the project. This command reads the instructions in the Dockerfile and creates an image, with the image name specified by us.</p>
<p>To run the Docker image, we used the command docker run --name <container name> <image name>. This command creates and runs a container, using the image we built previously, and assigns it the container name specified by us.</p>
<p>In this way, we were able to ensure that the application and its dependencies were isolated from the host system and could be easily deployed to different environments. It also helped us to standardize the environment and the dependencies across the team, making it easy to collaborate and reproduce the results.</p>
<h3>Question 16</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>When running into bugs while trying to run your experiments, how did you perform debugging? Additionally, did you</strong>
<strong>try to profile your code or do you think it is already perfect?</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>Debugging method was dependent on group member. Some just used ... and others used ... . We did a single profiling</em>
<em>run of our main code at some point that showed ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When running into bugs while trying to run our experiments, we mainly used simple print statements to perform debugging. This involved adding print statements to the code at key points to understand the flow of execution and identify where the bug might be occurring.</p>
<p>Additionally, we also used condaviz for profiling our code to identify any performance bottlenecks. Condaviz is a visualization tool that helps to identify where the performance bottlenecks are in the code, by analyzing the function call graph and the execution time of each function. This helped us to optimize the code where necessary and improve the performance of our models.</p>
<h2>Working in the cloud</h2>

<h3>Question 17</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>List all the GCP services that you made use of in your project and shortly explain what each service does?</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 50-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We used the following two services: Engine and Bucket. Engine is used for... and Bucket is used for...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cloud Build: A service that lets users build and test code in the cloud.</p>
<p>Cloud Run: A fully managed service for running stateless containers in the cloud.</p>
<p>Cloud Functions: A serverless compute service that lets users run code in response to specific events.</p>
<p>Vertex AI: A set of tools for machine learning and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Cloud Buckets: A service for storing and retrieving data in the cloud.</p>
<p>Container Registry: A service for storing and managing container images in the cloud.</p>
<h3>Question 18</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The backbone of GCP is the Compute engine. Explained how you made use of this service and what type of VMs</strong>
<strong>you used?</strong></p>

<p>Example:
<em>We used the compute engine to run our ... . We used instances with the following hardware: ... and we started the</em>
<em>using a custom container: ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We used a variety of different types of VMs depending on the specific requirements of our experiments. For example, we used standard VMs with a moderate amount of memory and CPU for running simple experiments and small-scale training jobs. For more demanding workloads, we used high-memory and high-CPU VMs, with large amounts of memory and CPU to handle large datasets and perform complex computations.</p>
<h3>Question 19</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Insert 1-2 images of your GCP bucket, such that we can see what data you have stored in it.</strong>
<strong>You can take inspiration from <a href="figures/bucket.png">this figure</a>.</strong></p>

<strong>your project. You can take inspiration from <a href="figures/build.png">this figure</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cloud build history can be seen in <a href="figures/hugging_build.jpeg">this figure</a> (this is only from one account, some other builds were made on other GCloud accounts).</p>
<h3>Question 22</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you manage to deploy your model, either in locally or cloud? If not, describe why. If yes, describe how and</strong>
<strong>preferably how you invoke your deployed service?</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>For deployment we wrapped our model into application using ... . We first tried locally serving the model, which</em>
<em>worked. Afterwards we deployed it in the cloud, using ... . To invoke the service an user would call</em>
<em><code>curl -X POST -F "file=@file.json"&lt;weburl&gt;</code></em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We wrapped out model into a simple Streamlit interface. After attempting to deploy our model to the cloud with Cloud RUN, we ran into port issues. In the end we managed to deploy a frontend doing inference using our model locally. Some screenshots of these are <a href="figures/hugging_cloud_run.png">figure</a> and <a href="figures/hugging_vertex.png">figure</a>.</p>

<em>We did not manage to implement monitoring. We would like to have monitoring implemented such that over time we could</em>
<em>measure ... and ... that would inform us about this ... behaviour of our application.</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We did not manage to implement monitoring. We would like to have monitoring implemented such that over time we could.</p>
<h3>Question 24</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How many credits did you end up using during the project and what service was most expensive?</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 25-100 words.</p>

<em>costing the most was ... due to ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In total we spent around 8 dollars. Mostly for attempting to host inference with our predict script. A test version was sent in a groupchat with my friends, and they all tested the app several times. Some other credits were spent on prototyping and experimetation, in order to see what components worked best.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Our ML Ops architecture includes the following components:</p>
<p>Data preparation: This includes data acquisition, cleaning, and preprocessing, which is the process of getting data ready for training and validation.</p>
<p>Model training: This is the process of training machine learning models on the prepared data. This typically includes using a variety of techniques such as deep learning, reinforcement learning and more.</p>
<p>Model deployment: This is the process of deploying the trained model into a production environment, which typically includes creating a container image and deploying it to a cluster of machines.</p>
<p>Monitoring: This includes monitoring the performance of the deployed model in production, collecting metrics and logs, and using them to evaluate the model’s performance and to detect and diagnose errors.</p>
<p>Model management: This includes maintaining the versioning, tracking and management of models, including their lineage, performance and compliance.</p>
<p>Automation: This includes automating the entire pipeline, from data preparation to model training, deployment, and monitoring.</p>
<h3>Question 26</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Discuss the overall struggles of the project. Where did you spend most time and what did you do to overcome these</strong>
<strong>challenges?</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 200-400 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>The biggest challenges in the project was using ... tool to do ... . The reason for this was ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our main struggles in the project actually stemmed from model deployment and continuous integration.</p>
<p>Model deployment was a challenge because it required us to containerize our models and deploy them to a cluster of machines. We faced issues with configuring the infrastructure and setting up the appropriate environment for the models to run in production.</p>
<p>Continuous integration was also a challenge as we needed to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying our models. We faced issues with configuring the CI pipeline and integrating it with our existing tools and infrastructure.</p>
<p>To overcome these challenges, we adopted a number of strategies. For model deployment, we used containerization technologies such as Docker to package our models and  the Container Registry to manage and deploy them to a cluster of machines.</p>
<p>For continuous integration, we set up a CI/CD pipeline using tools such as Jenkins and GitHub Actions. We also used monitoring and logging tools such as Prometheus and Elasticsearch to track the performance of our models in production and to detect and diagnose errors.</p>
<p>In summary, our main struggles in the project stemmed from model deployment and continuous integration. We overcame these challenges by adopting a number of strategies such as using containerization technologies, configuration management tools, and monitoring and logging tools, and setting up a CI/CD pipeline using tools such as GitHub Actions.</p>
